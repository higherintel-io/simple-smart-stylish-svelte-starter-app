# The Simple, Smart, Stylish Starter App For Svelte

## Using Vite, Svelte, Native Fetch, Tailwind 3 and Daisy UI component framework, the boilerplate lets full-stack developers quickly build beautiful frontends and consume APIs

---

### Why?

This has been my go-to setup for the last several months when I need to spin up a quick, but good looking and functional prototype. In order to avoid rebuilding this stack often, I created a boilerplate that contained everything I needed to quickly build a frontend interface that is ready to consume 3rd party APIs right away.

## Features

### Everything needed to quickly prototype a data-driven application with Vite, vanilla Svelte, Tailwind 3.0, Daisy UI and Fetch API

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - Component framework which compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JS.
- [Tailwind CSS V3](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com) - Tailwind Components Library - Free components for Tailwind CSS
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) - The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
- Path Alias - Easily import components from the same directory
- Custom Fetch Client - abstracts away common fetch boiler plate
